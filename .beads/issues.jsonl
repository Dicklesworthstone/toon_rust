{"id":"bd-14v","title":"Implement encode_stream_events function","description":"The encode_stream_events function in src/encode/mod.rs:32 is currently a todo!() stub. This should be implemented to emit JsonStreamEvent items during encoding, similar to how decode_stream_sync works for decoding.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-21T08:14:11.845775502Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-21T09:06:04.554477418Z","closed_at":"2026-01-21T09:06:04.554321635Z","close_reason":"Implemented encode_stream_events function with full test coverage. The function walks the JsonValue tree recursively and emits JsonStreamEvent items matching the pattern used by decode_stream_sync. Added 5 unit tests covering primitives, objects, arrays, quoted keys, and roundtrip compatibility.","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
